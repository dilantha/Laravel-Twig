# Laravel Twig - Laravel View Replacement

Laravel Twig is a clone of [TwigView](https://github.com/akhawaja/TwigView) which replaces the default Laravel View class with the 
[Twig Template Engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).

We use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) and the [composer bundle](http://bundles.laravel.com/bundle/composer) 
to fetch the Twig library.

##Install Composer
Install composer inside your project directory

	curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Create a **composer.json** file at the root of your project
  
	{
	    "require": {
	        "php": ">=5.3.0",
	        "twig/twig": "1.8.1"
	    }
	}

Install your composer packages, which will install the Twig library files in your **vendor/** directory.

	php composer.phar install  


## Install the Twig bundle

	php artisan bundle:install twig

That should install the **composer** bundle as well since its a dependancy.

In the **application/bundles.php** file, register the Composer and Twig bundles.

```php
return array(
	'composer' => array('auto' => true),
	'twigview' => array(
    'location' => 'twig', 'autoloads' => array(
        'map' => array(
            'TwigView\\View' => '(:bundle)/view.php',
        	)
    	)
    ),
);
```

### Replace the View alias (optional)

In the *application/config/application.php* file, replace the alias with the following:

```php
'aliases' => array(
    ...
    'View' => 'TwigView\\View',
);
```

If you leave the alias as-is, you can still call ```\TwigView\View``` in your controllers.

## Usage ##

All your views must have the **.twig** file extension. You can use the ```TwigView\View``` object in the same 
manner as the ```Laravel\View``` object. Just keep in mind that you are using Twig syntax inside your views.

For example call the Twig view like this

```php
$data = array('message' => 'Hello');
return \TwigView\View::make('home.index', $data);
``` 

If you aliased TwigView you can do this

```php
$data = array('message' => 'Hello');
return View::make('home.index', $data);
``` 

and in your **home/index.twig** do this

	{{ message }}
